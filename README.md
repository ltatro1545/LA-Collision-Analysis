# LA County Collision Analysis

# Overview

This project is looking at driver incidents to help vehicle manufacturers to evaluate what safety improvements would be the best to research and develop for the future based on the findings of accidents reported by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) in Los Angeles county.  The data collected includes information about the incident including the severity of the accident and the safety equipment used.  Based on the data collected the factors contributing to each incident will be evaluated to determine the most significant factors to resulting in severe and fatal incidents for cars, trucks and motorcycles.  This data can then be used to identify what new safety features should be the focus for manufacturers for the future.  

## Data
The Data sets were retreived from CHP.com, specifically from L.A. County with various data inputs about vehicle crashes from 2017,2018,2019.


### Machine Learning Model
Supervised unbalanced machince leanring. Investigating Forest Classifier Model.  

## Questions
    * Is there the ability/opportunity to improve the safety features of the data?
    
    * TBD, subject to change  

## Communication
    
    * Triangle - Joe
    
    * Square - Roger
    
    * Circle - Landon

The Group has 2 group chats and regular zoom calls. Communication flows freely and regularly.  3 branches exist. Group (as a whole) decides what goes into the main branch.

# Methodology

1. Collect and clean data

2. Create database and queries for machine learning modeling

3. Evaluate and prepare data for machine learning

4. Conduct supervised machine learning 

5. Prepare and present findings using Tableau
